                                                   Car Dealership Application
The purpose of the application is to provide the customers a convenient means to view and search for a car the dealership is selling. The dealership uses a website page that allows dealers to manage the stock of cars. This website should have an elegant website layout and good eye-catching navigation that guides the customers to buy vehicles and convert them from prospective buyers to customers who have faithful long-term associations with the dealers.
